I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/). I recieved my B.S. in electrical engineering with highest distinction from
[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/e_c_e/).

My research focuses on VLSI CAD.
