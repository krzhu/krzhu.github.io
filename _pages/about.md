### Keren Zhu (朱可人)

I am currently a research assistant professor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/), from August 2022 to February 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. at UT Austin ECE. I received my B.S. in electrical engineering with highest distinction from
[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/e_c_e/).

My research interest include custom circuit layout automation, machine learning for EDA and CAD for emerging technologies.

## I am looking for recruiting PhD/MPhil students at CUHK for Fall 2023. Research assistance positions are also available. Send me an email (kerenzhu AT cse.cuhk.edu.hk) if interested.
