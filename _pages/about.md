### Keren Zhu (朱可人)

I am currently an associate professor/青年研究员 in College ofintegrated Circuits & Micro-Nano Electronics at Fudan University.
I was a research assistant professor with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong from 2023-2024. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [David Z. Pan](http://www.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/), from August 2022 to February 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. at UT Austin ECE. I received my B.S. in electrical engineering with highest distinction from
[University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/e_c_e/).

My research interest include custom circuit layout automation, machine learning for EDA and CAD for emerging technologies.


## I am always looking for self-motivated PhD/Master/Post-Doc in the area of EDA and design. Please read the *Opening* and send me an email if interested.
